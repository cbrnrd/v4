Maliketh is a Command & Control (C2) framework that addresses a common shortcoming of malware implants: deterministic behavior. With its Malleable Profiles feature, operators can tailor the behavior of each implant to fit their specific needs, making it difficult for security solutions to detect them. Maliketh's customizable and multi-user server, easily configurable YAML files, and straightforward deployment using Docker make it a flexible and user-friendly platform for operators.
